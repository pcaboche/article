\maketitle



\begin{abstract}
	This article tries to solve some common problems in \LaTeX\ when dealing with texts in Chinese, Japanese, and other languages that use a non-Latin writing system. \\
	
	The first problem we intend to solve is related to \emph{portability}: making sure that a \LaTeX\ document containing texts in Japanese, Chinese (or other languages) can still be rendered in \Windows, \Linux, or other systems (i.e. all our dependencies will have to be freely available for different OSes). 
	
	This is a prerequisite to the second problem we want to solve: adding \emph{ruby} characters, (e.g. \emph{furigana}, \emph{pinyin}) to texts in Japanese, Chinese (and other languages). \\
	
	However, this article needed to go beyond solving those two issues; and for a better understanding we also had to provide some background information about related subjects, including: the type of fonts we'll use (and where to find them), \LaTeX, \emph{ruby} characters, and even a few words about the Japanese and Chinese language. \\
	
	By the end of this article, we will see what it involves to add \emph{ruby} characters in \LibreOffice\ and \Microsoft\ \Word, and see how they compare to \LaTeX\ for this type of task.
