\section{Introduction}

Every article tells a story, and this one is no different. \\

In this story, we go from being a complete \LaTeX\ novice, to writing documents like this one. 
Starting from nothing, we learn how to install a \LaTeX\ environment (for Windows or Linux), install \TeXstudio, create a new document, render it, then add all the necessary components to make a good report: sections, Table of Contents, cross-references, bibliography, index\dots \\

So this is the story about a \LaTeX\ document, talking about itself: many of the techniques used to produce this document are featured in this document, including some code samples. \\

In any case, sit back, relax, and enjoy the ride through our discovery of \LaTeX\dots
